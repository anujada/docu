<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
This web application was made as a prototype to solve the problems of employees working at MSF. The web application provides a digital platform for organization and easy access to the case files and invoices.  It eliminates the need to have physical signatures by having unique logins and creates an easy and streamlined process for the management of financial documents. The result of which is a real time auditing process that saves time.

Thr product is developed for employees at MSF to use internally. They will have individual logins which they will use to identify themselves. Additionally, it enables the employees to take pictures of the invoices and documents on their phone and upload it to the case file.
